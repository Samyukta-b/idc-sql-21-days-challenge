# Working with SQL Effectively

Today's session started with a reminder of the **Father of Relational Database Management Systems — Edgar F. Codd**.

Did you know that **SQL predates Excel by around a decade**? It originated with IBM's **SEQUEL** in **1970** and has since evolved through various stages, including:

- Establishment of SQL standards  
- Introduction of **integrity constraints**  
- Continuous **language enhancements**

### Key Takeaway

One important point that stood out to me was:  

> It doesn’t matter whether you can write the SQL query for a given problem. What truly matters is **understanding what is being asked** and **what kind of data needs to be retrieved**.  

It seems simple, but framing it this way really provides a **fresh perspective** on understanding data and SQL. It's about thinking in terms of data

### Future Facing

The future is AI tied up with Vector spaces, Relational data and Graph networks. An example is a blog post: 

> Foundation Model for Personalized Recommendation by Netflix Technology Blog

> How and Why Netflix Built a Real-Time Distributed Graph: Part 1 — Ingesting and Processing Data Streams at Internet Scale by Netflix Technology Blog

Their idea is to make use of:

- **Relational data:** To store user info, watch history in structred data, which is ransformed into graph format using nodes and edges
- **Vector space:** turning users, items and interactions into vector embeddings which are numerical representation that can be used by AI to compare and match similarities, thereby tailoring recommendations
- **Graph networks:** this captures the relationships between users, content and their interactions with the same to understand recommendations, likes and dislikes better
